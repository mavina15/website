		    <th><p style="background-color: white; color: black; text-align: justify">My pursuit of a bachelors of science in applied mathematics is attributed to my enjoyment of adversity for solving complex problems using efficient solutions. When I took Calculus, Differential Equations and Linear Algebra I realized that I suffered from weak addition, subtraction, multiplication and division skills. This prolonged my advancement in math and intake of advanced concepts that would build upon my prior math education.

			The inclusion of computer science and electrical engineering classes fuels my fascination of computers being used for socially responsible and beneficial projects. At the moment, I intend to study aquaponics and its potency on the health of communities of color with the aid of the UC Davis Green Initiative Fund. Aquaponics can bring students, to benefit and be exposed to sustainably growing edible plants and fish while also being exposed to technology with the use of IoT.</p></th>

		    <th><p style="background-color: white; color: black; text-align: justify">At the moment, I am studying aquaponics and its potency on the health of working class communities of color in the Los Angeles area. For example the cities of Lennox, Inglewood, and Hawthorne have limited options when it comes to healthy and fresh food; there are barriers for the residents of these neighborhoods, like cost, that make it more difficult and less likely for people to adopt a healthy lifestyle. Aquaponics can bring community members, more specifically children, to be exposed to sustainably growing edible plants and edible fish while also being exposed to technology with the use of automation. This project covers essential ideas in biology, chemistry, math, physics, and computer science. By introducing students to STEM, they have the opportunity to develop critical thinking and problem solving skills early on, which can give them a competitive advantage later on in life.</p></th>

		    <th><h3>Math Education</h3></th>
		    <th><p style="background-color: white; color: black; text-align: justify">As a senior, I intend to apply to education programs in pursuit of Math teaching credentials employing a social justice and equity philosophy. As an educator, my goal is to expose youth of color to STEM in a way that builds them up to be agents of change in the present and future, if we are lucky to be guaranteed one. I want to help underrepresented students from Los Angeles bridge concepts in Algebra and Calculus to their everyday life, as it is where the educational system excludes so many students.</p></th>

		<p style="width: 600px; text-align: justify;">Mel is a community college student from Santa Monica College. In the Fall, she will be transferring as an undergraduate in the Applied Mathematics department at UC Davis. During the summer, Mel will be completing a research project under the guidance of Ankur Mehta. The goal is to create a graphical user interface suitable for 5-year olds to change parameters of a 3D model boat, this relies on creating a widget that is measured in terms of efficiency and creativity.</p>
